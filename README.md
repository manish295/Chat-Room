# Chat Room
Just a simple chat room website using Python sockets.
## Disclaimer
The front-end code for this is not very good because this project was mainly focusing on the Python back-end.<br>
Please do not expect any security for the messaging, this was merely meant to be a fun project.
# Libraries
