Just a simple web chat room using Python sockets.
## Disclaimer
The front-end code for this is not very good because this project was mainly focusing on the Python back-end.
# Libraries
* ## [Sockets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)
* ## [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
